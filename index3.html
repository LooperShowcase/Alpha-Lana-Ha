<h1>THE FOUNDER</h1>
<p>Gabrielle Chanel lived her life as she alone intended.<br> The trials of a childhood as an orphan 
and the successes of an accomplished businesswoman gave birth to an extraordinary character; daring, free,
and ahead of her time.<br> Faithful friendships and passionate love affairs, as well as a thirst for culture,
discovery and travel helped shaped her personality. A wardrobe freed from constraints and superfluity, tweaked with masculine accents,
created a visionary allure that has become timeless and yet wildly modern.<br>
 Pearls and diamonds casually paired with iconic perfumes have created a signature style...<br>
That of an avant-garde woman, a pioneer whose lifestyle and multiple facets forged the values of the House she founded, 
and who remains an inspiration for all women.</p>
<h1>THE HISTORY</h1>

   <h3>1883</h3>
<h4>BIRTH OF GABRIELLE CHANEL</h4>

   <h3>1952</h3>
   <h4>MARILYN MONROE & N°5</h4>
   <p>Life Magazine dedicated its feature story to Marilyn Monroe on April 7th 1952.<br>

      When asked, Marilyn, what do you wear to bed? Marilyn Monroe answered, So I said I only wear Chanel No.5.<br>
